# Binary Journey

Hello there. You can call me Steve - Currently living in Switzerland.  
I'm a trained computer specialist (Informatiker EFZ Diploma in Switzerland), but with no specific specialization (Didn't exist back then - Accordingly, the training was interpreted generalist, so a little bit of everything). Afterwards I worked as a system administrator until today and still do. I already noticed back then, when I created very simple websites, that I love programming. This became especially clear at work, when I automated tasks with the help of scripts. Now I want to focus more on programming, because I have several projects in mind, which I want to realize in the course of time.    

... âœ¨ through Git I would like to record this process.
